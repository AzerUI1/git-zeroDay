# 🚀 Learning Git & Leveling Up in C/C++

Welcome!
This repository represents my journey of mastering **Git** and diving deeper into **C and C++ programming**.
It’s all about becoming more confident with system-level development, version control, and real-world project workflows.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

### 🔹 Git & GitHub

* Creating repositories locally and remotely
* Staging, committing, pushing, and pulling
* Branching and merging like a pro
* Handling merge conflicts (no crying 😅)
* `.gitignore`, LICENSE files, and clean commit history
* Cloning and collaborating with others

### 🔹 Programming in C & C++

* Variables, data types, operators
* Functions and modular code
* Pointers, memory allocation, arrays, strings
* Object-oriented basics in C++
* Debugging with `gdb`
* Building programs with `make`, `gcc`, and `g++`

---

## 🛠 Tools & Requirements

To follow along or try the code yourself, you’ll need:

* **Git** (for version control)
* **GCC / G++** (compilers)
* **Linux / macOS / WSL** (best environment)
* **Make** (optional but recommended)

Example compile commands:

```bash
gcc program.c -o app
./app
```

For C++:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o app
./app
```

## ✅ Goals & Motivation

By working through this repo, I want to:

✔ Understand how computers really work
✔ Build fast and efficient programs
✔ Manage all code cleanly with Git
✔ Prepare for bigger real-world development projects
✔ Eventually contribute to open-source 💡
